![Network Topology](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f06ac1b-59b5-4987-b80c-016e0cede398)

## 📘 Project Description

This project simulates the planning and implementation of a scalable, secure, and redundant enterprise network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Designed for a startup company with **750 employees**, the network spans **three floors** and supports **six departments** with both wired and wireless connectivity.

The architecture is based on a **3-tier hierarchical model** (Core, Distribution, Access) and integrates **two Internet Service Providers** (MTN and Airtel) to ensure redundancy and high availability.

### 🔧 Key Features:
- Departmental segmentation using **VLANs**.
- **Subnetting** of the network as per requirements.
- Implementation of **OSPF routing protocol**.
- **Wireless access points** configured for each department.
- **Remote management** enabled via secure **SSH**.
- **Extra security** enforced for the Finance and Accounts department.
- Deployment of internal **Web**, **DHCP** and **DNS servers**.
- **Failover and redundancy** tested with dual ISPs.
- Complete **connectivity and communication** testing across all departments.

This project demonstrates practical enterprise networking concepts such as hierarchical design, redundancy, access control, subnetting, and service deployment—ideal for academic use, certification preparation, or portfolio demonstration.
